## 💻 Technical Implementation

### State Management

#### Level-Up Modal
```javascript
const [levelUpModalVisible, setLevelUpModalVisible] = useState(false);
const [levelUpData, setLevelUpData] = useState({ 
  level: 1, 
  points: 0 
});
```

#### Streak Milestone Modal
```javascript
const [streakMilestoneVisible, setStreakMilestoneVisible] = useState(false);
const [streakMilestoneData, setStreakMilestoneData] = useState({ 
  streak: 0 
});
```

### Trigger Logic

#### Level-Up Detection
```javascript
const incrementPoints = async (points: number) => {
  const currentPoints = stats.points + points;
  const newLevel = Math.floor(currentPoints / 100) + 1;
  
  if (newLevel > stats.level) {
    setLevelUpData({ level: newLevel, points: currentPoints });
    setLevelUpModalVisible(true);
  }
};
```

#### Streak Milestone Detection
```javascript
const incrementStreak = async () => {
  // After incrementing streak
  if ([5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100].includes(newStreak)) {
    setStreakMilestoneData({ streak: newStreak });
    setStreakMilestoneVisible(true);
  }
};
```

### Modal Properties
```javascript
<Modal
  visible={levelUpModalVisible}
  transparent={true}
  animationType="slide"  // Slides up from bottom
  onRequestClose={() => setLevelUpModalVisible(false)}
>
```

### Dismissal Handler
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={styles.celebrationModalContainer}
  activeOpacity={1}
  onPress={() => setLevelUpModalVisible(false)}
>
```
